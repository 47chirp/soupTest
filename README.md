# soupTest

The premise for the game is based upon the game "Higher or Lower" (https://www.higherlowergame.com/) with a much simpler design and idea attached.

Each user is prompted with 5 images per game played, where they must determine whether the image is a picture of soup or whether the image is something else.

At the start of the game a random number generator selects an image, setting a boolean value to the type of image.

This image then pops out into the computer's default photo editor (in the case of this game it's Mac's Preview feature).

While simple, there are numerous ways in which this could be expanded to allow for increased flexibility and playability.

From different themes to the incorporation of blurred frames that correspond to point values, there are numerous ways in which to expand this.

One of the hardest things about this project ultimately was the way in which the images were opened and displayed.

Rather than using a more formal gui, the initial goal was to have the image pop out, which proved to be more time consuming than expected.

Going forward, the implementation of a gui could create a more seemless experience for the user, but for the sake of the game the functionality is currently fine.
